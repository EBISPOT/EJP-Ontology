Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its\ncurrent place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to\n'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue\nfor now." xsd:string
