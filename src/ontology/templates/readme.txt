Editing the templates 

1. The template file is meant to add additional terms to the ontology, e.g. in the case of a new rare disease category the template file for rare diseases file i.e. the new category should be included in the src/ontology/templates/rare-diseases-category.tsv file alongside it other information and contained in the file. 

2. After creating a new diseases category, open the src/ontology/templates/rare-disease.tsv and edit it by adding the new sub-categories of the categories created in the the src/ontology/templates/rare-diseases-category.tsv in the file.
